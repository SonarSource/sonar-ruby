<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a method name does not match a provided regular expression.</p>
<p>For example, with the default provided regular expression, the following method:</p>
<pre>
def methodName # Noncompliant
   expr..
end
</pre>
<p>should be renamed to</p>
<pre>
def method_name
   expr..
end
</pre>
