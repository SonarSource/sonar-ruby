<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Functions with a long parameter list are difficult to use, as maintainers must figure out the role of each parameter and keep track of their
position.</p>
<pre>
def modify(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) # Noncompliant
 # ...
end
</pre>
<p>The solution can be to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Split the function into smaller ones </li>
</ul>
<pre>
# Each function does a part of what the original distance function was doing, so confusion risks are lower
def move(x, y, z)
   # ...
end

def resize(width, height, depth)
   # ...
end
</pre>
<ul>
  <li> Find a better data structure for the parameters that group data in a way that makes sense for the specific application domain </li>
</ul>
<pre>
Point = Struct.new(:x, :y, :z) # In geometry, Point is a logical structure to group data

def modify(p1, p2)
 # ...
end
</pre>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a function has more parameters than the provided threshold.</p>
