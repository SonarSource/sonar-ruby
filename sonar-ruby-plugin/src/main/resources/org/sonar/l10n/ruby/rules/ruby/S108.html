<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>An empty code block is confusing. It will require some effort from maintainers to determine if it is intentional or indicates the implementation is
incomplete.</p>
<pre>
def compute(a, b)
  sum = a + b
  if  sum &gt; 0 # Noncompliant: is the block empty on purpose, or is code missing?
  end
  puts "Result: #{sum}"
end
</pre>
<p>Removing or filling the empty code blocks takes away ambiguity and generally results in a more straightforward and less surprising code.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The rule ignores:</p>
<ul>
  <li> code blocks that contain comments </li>
  <li> <code>while</code> loops </li>
</ul>
<pre>
while @order.process_next; end # Compliant by exception
</pre>
